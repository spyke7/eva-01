## **Documentation**

I have seen the **Neon Genesis Evangelion** anime by Hideaki Anno, and was really moved by the concepts of EVAs. EVA-01 run by the protagonist was a special one for me as it could change to berserk mode and many other different capabilites. Also, I was moved by the NERV HQ as mentioned in anime and its computer system having central dogma and terminal dogma.
</br>

Based on this computer system mentioned in anime, the eva-01 also has two header files - `CentralDogma.hpp` and `TerminalDogma.hpp`. 
### **About the CentralDogma**
- The main `parseCommand()` function, is used to execute commands, store them in history, also the logic for `||`,`;`, and `&&` are implemented. Along with that the command to run a command from history with its index is also implemented - `!<index_number>`
- Inside it has a registry keeping the records of the commands along with the names with which they will be called. The registry filling is done inside the main function.
- `searchHistory()` function is used by `history` function inside the `TerminalDogma` to search particular commands with related names.

### **About the TerminalDogma**

- It has a brief abstract base class for all eva-01 shell commands. It defines the common interface for every shell command. Each command has its own behaviour in `execute()` and the `description()` is written inside the header file only.
- All the commands implemented inside it are described in the commands section.
- For the `calc()` function many other functions like `isNumber()`, `isLeftAssociative()`, `precedence()`, `postfix()` - to change infix to postfix along with brackets, `solvePostfix()` are implemented.
  

### Commands:
- [x] history - It shows all the previous commands executed and also searches commands related with command name(s) given. To run a particular command from history with their index - `!<index_number>`
- [x] shift - Moves and renames files/folders. `shift <file1> <folder1/file1>` or `shift <folder2/folder3> <folder4/folder3>`
        You need to give the name of the file/folder along with the destination you want to move.
        For renaming you just need to give a new name in the second arguement.
- [x] view - Displays the content of the files. `view <file1> <file2> <...>`
- [x] time - It just shows you the time.
- [x] forge - It makes directory. Command - `forge <directory1> <directory2> <...>`
- [x] calc - Just a simple calculator.
- [x] say - Prints text to the console and also write and appends text into files which are in double quotes only
         and ends with >> and file name with proper space. `say <text>` or `say <"text"> >> <filename>`
- [x] clear - Clears the console.
- [x] show - Shows all the folder and files present in the working directory.
- [x] jump - Changes the directory to the given directory.
- [x] help - Gives information about the commands
- [x] erase - Deletes the provided files and folders. `erase <file1> <folder1> <file2> <...>`
- [x] craft - Creates files only. `craft <file1> <file2> <...>`
